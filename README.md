# Module
I am sharing my own module. The problems it addresses can be both specific and general. However, the functions and classes are generalized and are built following the Pythonic way principles. I plan to add and expand on the functions over time.

The codes will be added based on my own ML Workflow. For the ML Workflow link:

I have over 250 unorganized python files. All files contains various functions. I will add them as I edit them. Be patient and follow. If you want to contibution , just ask. :)
